# Remote Development Environment

## About LeRobot

**LeRobot** is Hugging Face's open-source robotics library that provides models, datasets, and tools for real-world robotics in PyTorch. The project focuses on imitation learning and reinforcement learning to enable robots to learn from human demonstrations.

### Project Context
- **Repository:** `/home/thor/lerobot`
- **Installation:** Editable install with `uv pip install -e ".[feetech]"`
- **Key Dependencies:**
  - PyTorch 2.9.1+cu130 (CUDA 13.0)
  - Feetech Servo SDK (for SO-ARM101 motors)
  - ffmpeg (for video encoding/decoding)
- **Purpose:** Training and deploying AI policies for the SO-ARM101 robotic arm
- **Workflow:** Data collection → Training → Policy deployment

### SO-ARM101 Robot
- Low-cost robotic arm designed by TheRobotStudio and Hugging Face
- Uses 6x STS3215 Feetech servos with magnetic encoders
- Supports teleoperation (leader arm) and autonomous control
- Compatible with LeRobot's imitation learning pipeline
- Documentation: [Seeed Studio Wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/lerobot_so100m/)

## System Configuration
- **Server:** Jetson AGX Thor (JetPack 7.0, Python 3.12, CUDA 13.0)
  - PyTorch: 2.9.1+cu130
  - CUDA: 13.0 (Active)
  - Device: NVIDIA Thor
  - Headless environment (no local display server)
  - No DISPLAY or WAYLAND_DISPLAY environment variables

- **Client:** MacBook M3
  - Connects to Jetson via SSH tunnel
  - Uses Cursor IDE with remote file server access
  - Files accessed from THOR using Cursor's remote file system

## Robot Configuration
- **Robot Type:** SO-ARM101 Follower Arm
- **USB Port:** `/dev/ttyACM0`
- **Robot ID:** `thor_follower_arm`
- **Motor Configuration:**
  - 6x STS3215 motors with IDs 1-6
  - shoulder_pan (ID 1)
  - shoulder_lift (ID 2)
  - elbow_flex (ID 3)
  - wrist_flex (ID 4)
  - wrist_roll (ID 5)
  - gripper (ID 6)
- **Calibration File:** `~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/calibration/robots/so101_follower/thor_follower_arm.json`
- **Status:** Calibrated and connected
- **Note:** Some joints may be at calibration limits; use raw encoder positions to move to center if needed

## Development Implications
- GUI applications require headless mode or remote viewing solutions
- Visualization scripts should default to save mode (`--save 1`) or distant/server mode (`--mode distant`)
- Never assume a local display is available
- When suggesting fixes for display-related errors, recommend `--save` or `--mode distant` flags
- All file operations occur on the remote Jetson server, not the local MacBook
